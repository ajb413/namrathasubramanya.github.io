# Motivation
Dog walkers have steadily become more and more visible in the developed world. As adult professionals increasingly postpone having families, dogs have become “starter children,” and thus dog walkers feature in everyday life much as babysitters have for generations. Professional dog walkers have been around for at least 80 years. On January 5, 1935, The New York Times published an article, headlined “Walking the Dog Big Business,” that reported on the plans of James Daley, a 34-year-old building super who was days away from opening the offices of Daily Dogwalking Service on Broadway, north of Columbus Circle. Decades later, as the demand for dog walking has grown in particularly dense, gentrifying urban centers, many an entrepreneur has seized upon it as a scalable service enterprise like any other.
